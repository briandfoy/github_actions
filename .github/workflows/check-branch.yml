# To play with this, choose which OS you want to exclude. Suppose that's
# macOS. Make a branch that starts with 'macos' after a / (so, macos at
# the start or a topic branch like topic/macos). Commit and push.
#
# This is probably tricky, but conceivably you could make a branch like
# ubuntu/macos/windows and all of these would trigger. That way you
# can construct a branch that selects more than one job to run
